Unvanquished legacy assets
==========================


About
-----

This is a resource package providing legacy sounds and emoticons to the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

Most of those legacy assets are inherited from the the [Tremulous](https://tremulous.net) game project.

The purpose of this package is to be ditched one day.

Visit the [Unvanquished website](https://unvanquished.net/) for more information about the game itself.
